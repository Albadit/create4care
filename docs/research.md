For example, Seeed’s product page confirms the 3–350 cm range and 2 mm accuracy spec ([Grove - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqkO7R5b88P2CO6w_r-MIMH-YGS2HJtEuJfExklKj4qGMmnn_QD#:~:text=The%20Grove%20,proximity%20sensors%2C%20and%20ultrasonic%20detectors)). (This sensor is essentially a Grove-packaged HC-SR04-type module.)

## **Grove TF Mini LiDAR** (Seeed Studio) – *LiDAR Time-of-Flight*

The **TF Mini LiDAR** is a compact **Time-of-Flight LiDAR** module in the Grove form factor. It uses an infrared laser to measure distance and achieves high-speed readings:

- **Accuracy:** About **±1% of the measured distance** for ranges <6 m (and ±2% from 6–12 m) ([Grove - TF Mini LiDAR | Seeed Studio Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TF_Mini_LiDAR/#:~:text=Product%20Name%20TFmini%20Operating%20range,12m)). In practical terms, this means the error is only a few millimeters at close range (e.g. ~3 mm at 30 cm), growing to ~3–4 cm at around 3–4 m.
- **Measurement Range:** **30 cm to 12 m** (0.3 m to 12 m) ([Grove - TF Mini LiDAR | Seeed Studio Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TF_Mini_LiDAR/#:~:text=Product%20Name%20TFmini%20Operating%20range,12m)). *Note:* It doesn’t measure nearer than ~30 cm, so it wouldn’t catch objects closer than that. But it easily covers 350 cm (3.5 m) and beyond.
- **Interface:** Uses a UART interface (115200 bps) via the Grove connector (4-pin). Power requirement is 5 V (with ~0.6 W consumption) ([Grove - TF Mini LiDAR | Seeed Studio Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TF_Mini_LiDAR/#:~:text=Product%20Name%20TFmini%20Operating%20range,12m)).
- **Technology:** **LiDAR (Time-of-Flight infrared)** – emits 850 nm IR laser pulses and times their reflections. It has a narrow field-of-view (~2.3°) for precise targeting ([Grove - TF Mini LiDAR | Seeed Studio Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TF_Mini_LiDAR/#:~:text=Product%20Name%20TFmini%20Operating%20range,12m)).

- **Measurement Range:** **~4 cm to 400 cm** (0.04 m to 4 m) ([SparkFun Distance Sensor Breakout - 4 Meter, VL53L1X (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-distance-sensor-breakout-4-meter-vl53l1x-qwiic.html#:~:text=Each%20VL53L1X%20sensor%20features%20a,3.5V%20to)). This covers the 5 cm–350 cm span (up to about 4 m max). It’s most accurate at close and mid-range; ST cites “accurate ranging up to 4 m” in a tiny package ([VL53L1X - Time-of-Flight (ToF) ranging sensor based on ST's FlightSense technology - STMicroelectronics](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html#:~:text=The%20VL53L1X%20is%20a%20state,frequency%20up%20to%2050%20Hz)).
- **Interface:** I²C interface (with 3.3 V or 5 V compatibility on breakout boards). Some breakouts (like SparkFun’s) include a Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector for plug-and-play use (similar convenience to Grove).
- **Technology:** **Infrared Time-of-Flight** – a 940 nm **VCSEL** laser emitter and SPAD photon detector measure distance by timing the light round-trip. It’s immune to target color or lighting, with a moderate field-of-view (~15–27°) ([SparkFun Distance Sensor Breakout - 4 Meter, VL53L1X (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-distance-sensor-breakout-4-meter-vl53l1x-qwiic.html#:~:text=Each%20VL53L1X%20sensor%20features%20a,3.5V%20to)).
- **Availability:** Offered as breakout modules from various vendors (e.g. **SparkFun** sells it for about **\$23** ([SparkFun Distance Sensor Breakout - 4 Meter, VL53L1X (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-distance-sensor-breakout-4-meter-vl53l1x-qwiic.html#:~:text=Each%20VL53L1X%20sensor%20features%20a,3.5V%20to)), and Pololu for ~$19). These modules are small and can be adapted to Grove connectors with jumpers or a Grove I²C socket. They are a good choice when you need **millimeter-level precision** in the 0.05–4 m range.

Each of the above sensors meets the general range and accuracy requirements, with the **Grove Ultrasonic** excelling at close-range coverage (down to ~3–5 cm) and ~2 mm accuracy ([Grove - Ultrasonic Distance Sensor - Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic-Distance-Sensor.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqkO7R5b88P2CO6w_r-MIMH-YGS2HJtEuJfExklKj4qGMmnn_QD#:~:text=The%20Grove%20,proximity%20sensors%2C%20and%20ultrasonic%20detectors)), the **TF Mini LiDAR** covering a very wide range up to 12 m with ~1% distance error ([Grove - TF Mini LiDAR | Seeed Studio Wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TF_Mini_LiDAR/#:~:text=Product%20Name%20TFmini%20Operating%20range,12m)), and the **VL53L1X IR ToF** offering high precision (1 mm resolution) in a compact form factor ([SparkFun Distance Sensor Breakout - 4 Meter, VL53L1X (Qwiic)](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-distance-sensor-breakout-4-meter-vl53l1x-qwiic.html#:~:text=Each%20VL53L1X%20sensor%20features%20a,3.5V%20to)). All can be integrated with Arduino or other microcontrollers, and the first two are directly Grove-compatible for quick plug-in play. When purchasing, check the provided links/specs to ensure the module matches your needs (voltage, interface, etc.), and note any distance blind zones (for example, LiDAR modules like the TF Mini can’t read below ~30 cm).
